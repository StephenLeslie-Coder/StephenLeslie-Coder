### 👨🏾‍💻 About Me

I’m a results-driven **Software Engineer** with a strong focus on **backend systems, APIs, and scalable architectures**.

I currently work extensively with **Java & Spring Boot**, cloud infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines, while also building entrepreneurial side projects in my own time.
